## Notes

Usability: measure of how effectively a person can:

Design Principles: 
- Place name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to the home page.
- Provide search if site has > 100 pages.
- Write straighforward and simple page titles that clearly explain what the page is about.
- Avoid cramming everything into single page without navigation tool.

Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience:
- Spends most of their time on other sites, so that's where they form their expectations for how a webpage should work.
- If most big websites do something in a certain way, then follow along
    - Users will expect things to work the same on your site.
    - Larger sites often perform extensive UI research.
- Test your design with real users as a reality check. People do things in an odd an unexpected ways, so even the most carefully created websites end up failing.
